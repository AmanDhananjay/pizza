The server should be a concurrent server servicing multiple clients

Database can be implemented using Oracle 9i or above

To begin with, the application should support at least 1 admin

Compilation and Build should be done using Eclipse IDE

Source-code and all documents must be maintained (checked-in) in configuration management system (subversion)

Wiproâ€™s coding standards (for Java) should be followed

Deliverables should include use-case diagrams, design document, compiled and tested source code, test-plans, test-cases documents, test-results and release note
